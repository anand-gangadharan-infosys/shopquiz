How to build

Import the project to eclipse as an eclipse maven project. You have the option to run it in Eclipse now.
Alternative option to build a jar for distribution. For this if you have m2e plugin in eclipse, just right click and Run As Maven Install. Check the target folder for results.

The real quick way is to run the quick-simulate-1.0.jar which I built in the home directory.

java -jar quick-simulate-1.0.jar
